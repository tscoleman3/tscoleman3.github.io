Mae (she/her) joined Dr. Matt Catalano's lab as a research assistant around the same time that I began graduate school. She assisted us with field work and data collection, data entry, and fish workup, even though she did not *love* fishes. Mae never said no, and would do the jobs we asked her, no matter how gruesome or boring they were. She was an awesome research associate. Mae is currently a Ph.D. student in Biomedical Sciences at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University. Good luck and have fun out there, Mae!
