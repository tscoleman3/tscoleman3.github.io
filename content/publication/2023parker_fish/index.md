abstract: Managing impounded river systems is a recurring challenge for aquatic resource professionals because reservoirs serve multiple functions with different ecological and socioeconomic outcomes. However, research on fishes in reservoirs has disproportionately focused on recreationally and economically important species, with less attention directed toward fish assemblages despite the potential for management at the assemblage level. As such, evaluation of relationships between reservoir fish assemblages and biotic and abiotic factors and testing whether assemblage structure is affected by changing environmental conditions may deepen ecological understanding and provide insights for reservoir fisheries management. Our overall objective was to assess these relationships in 11 reservoirs from North Carolina, USA. We sampled fish assemblages in the reservoirs, which spanned five river basins representing a range of habitat conditions, using experimental gillnets and pulsed DC nighttime electrofishing. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated that taxonomic differences in fish assemblage composition among river basins followed a gradient of productivity. The top contributing species to reservoir dissimilarity were bluegill (*Lepomis macrochirus*), gizzard shad (*Dorosoma cepedianum*), black crappie (*Pomoxis nigromaculatus*), and white perch (*Morone americana*). These four species were positively associated with factors that reflect increasing eutrophic conditions in the 11 reservoirs and could, therefore, serve as indicators of reservoir productivity, anthropogenic influence, and fish assemblage structure, in addition to their key role in reservoir fisheries management. Whereas fisheries research has historically focused on assessing fish populations, our results illustrate the ecological and management insights derived from simultaneously collecting assemblage- and population-level data. Research on reservoir fish assemblages in relation to biotic and abiotic conditions may help advance fish ecology and management alike.
