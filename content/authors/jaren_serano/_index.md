Jaren (he/him) was a M.Sc. student at the University of Florida in the Florida Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit in Dr. Ray Carthy's lab. He studied the effects of tidally-driven gas exchange on sea turtle hatchling emergence. I was unofficially on his committee due to my status as a Ph.D. student. Jaren went home to work on turtles in Belize after completing his degree, but is now back at the University of Florida as a Ph.D. student.
