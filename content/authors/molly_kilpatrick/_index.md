Molly (she/her) joined Dr. Matt Catalano's lab as a research assistant for Rob Eckelbecker and me my last year as a student. She assisted us with field work and data collection, data entry, and fish workup on numerous reservoirs. She always worked hard and had a smile on her face. War Eagle, Molly!
