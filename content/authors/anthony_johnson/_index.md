Anthony (he/him) was an M.Sc. student at Southeastern Louisiana University in the Department of Biological Sciences with Dr. Chris Murray and me. He studied the landscape physiology and drivers of stress proxies in a southeastern Louisiana American alligator (*Alligator mississippiensis*) population. He is currently pursing his Ph.D. at the University of Florida. Go Gators!
