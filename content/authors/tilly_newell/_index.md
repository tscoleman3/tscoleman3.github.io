Tilly (she/her) is an M.Sc. student at Southeastern Louisiana University in the Department of Biological Sciences coadvised by Dr. Kyle Piller and me. She is investigating if eDNA can be used to estimate anchovy abundance of benthic trawls in Lake Maurepas. In other words, can we use eDNA to estimate abundance so we don't have to count thousands of anchovies every trawl?
