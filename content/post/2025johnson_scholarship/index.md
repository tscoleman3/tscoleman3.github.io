ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations to {{< mention "anthony_johnson" >}} for being awarded the 2024 Joseph Ramspott Memorial Endowed Scholarship! This will provide him extra funding.

Anthony earned this award through the extraordinary scope and impact of his research. His thesis on alligator physiology in Lake Maurepas required catching and sampling more than one hundred alligators, generating one of the most comprehensive physiological datasets for the species in the region. In addition, he broadened his research portfolio with a side project on largemouth bass physiology and ecotoxicology, and he collected physiological metrics from catfish throughout Maurepas.

This combination of dedication, fieldwork intensity, and scientific breadth highlights why Anthony stood out as a deserving recipient of the Joseph Ramspott Memorial Endowed Scholarship.
