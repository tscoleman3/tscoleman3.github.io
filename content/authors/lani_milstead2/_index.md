Lani (she/her) is a familiar face, as she previously allowed me to be on her M.Sc. committee. She is now a research associate for the Lake Maurepas Monitoring Program at Southeastern Louisiana University in the Center for Environmental Research and Department of Biological Sciences. She is assisting the physiology team with research, while pursuing Ph.D. opportunities.
