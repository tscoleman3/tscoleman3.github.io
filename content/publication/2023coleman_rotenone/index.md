abstract: Objective - Reducing Largemouth Bass *Micropterus salmoides* recruitment and therefore population density could benefit recreational fisheries in small impoundments by improving individual growth rates and increasing the average size and condition of Largemouth Bass. To achieve these effects, methods of controlling Largemouth Bass recruitment should avoid reducing the productivity of their primary prey species, the Bluegill *Lepomis macrochirus*. Methods - We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the effects of shoreline rotenone application on the density of Bluegill and the density, growth, and survival of age‐0 and age‐1 Largemouth Bass in 15 Alabama small impoundments. Result - After treatment, Largemouth Bass age‐0 densities declined and mean age‐1 length increased, whereas Bluegill populations were not significantly reduced. Conclusion - Our study indicates that shoreline rotenone application may be a valuable method for reducing Largemouth Bass recruitment and increasing the growth of age‐1 Largemouth Bass in small impoundments. However, further research is needed to understand the effects of treatment on nontarget fishes and to better assess the effects of factors such as impoundment surface area and treatment frequency and duration on the ultimate utility of the approach.
